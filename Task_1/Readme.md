# Simple Calculator Console Application

## Overview

This project implements a console-based calculator in Java, allowing users to perform basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division). The application takes user input for numbers and operations, displaying the results in the console.

## Features

- Addition: Performs the addition of two numbers.
- Subtraction: Subtracts the second number from the first.
- Multiplication: Multiplies two given numbers.
- Division: Divides the first number by the second (handles division by zero).

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/CodeRreaper69/CodeClause_Java/tree/main/Task_1
    ```

2. Navigate to the Task_1 directory:

    ```bash
    cd CodeClause_Java/Task_1
    ```

3. Compile the Java files:

    ```bash
    javac CALC.java CALCULATOR.java
    ```

4. Run the calculator application:

    ```bash
    java CALCULATOR
    ```

5. Follow the on-screen instructions to perform calculations.

## Advantages

- **User-Friendly Interface**: The console-based interface provides a straightforward user experience.
- **Error Handling**: The program handles division by zero, providing a meaningful message to the user.
- **Modular Code Structure**: The calculator functionality is encapsulated in a separate class (`CALC`), promoting code organization and reusability.

## Next Steps

- **Enhance User Interface**: Consider upgrading the interface, perhaps to a graphical user interface (GUI) for improved user experience.
- **Additional Features**: Implement more advanced mathematical operations or scientific calculator functionalities.
- **Unit Testing**: Develop and include unit tests to ensure the calculator functions correctly in various scenarios.

## Learning Experience

- **Java Basics**: Reinforced understanding of basic Java concepts, including classes, methods, and user input handling.
- **Error Handling**: Learned how to handle common errors, such as division by zero, gracefully.
- **Version Control (Git)**: Practiced using Git for version control and collaborating on GitHub.
